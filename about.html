                         Currently I live about a half hour away from URI where I am currently enrolled as a computer
                          science major. I have three sisters and a dog named Maddy. I currently work part time at 
                          Staples in westerly. </p>

                        college and work, I still do my best to play. I enjoy strategy the most, but I still like FPS and
                         most other genres.
